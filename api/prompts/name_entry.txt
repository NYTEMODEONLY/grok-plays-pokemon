You see the NAME ENTRY screen.

TWO TYPES OF NAME SCREENS:

1. NAME PRESET LIST:
   Shows options like: NEW NAME, RED, ASH, JACK (or BLUE, GARY, JOHN for rival)
   ACTION: Select a preset name (NOT "NEW NAME") - press A

2. NAME ENTRY GRID:
   Shows: Name at top (like "A______")
          Letter grid below
          "ED" button at bottom-right = END/confirm

   ACTION: Navigate to "ED" button and press A to confirm
   - Use arrows to move cursor through letter grid
   - The "ED" or "END" option is usually at bottom-right corner
   - Press A on "ED" to confirm the current name

IMPORTANT:
- Selecting a preset name is FASTER than typing
- If on grid, navigate to ED/END to confirm current name
- Don't keep pressing A on letters - navigate to END
