Screen type could not be determined with confidence.

FALLBACK STRATEGY:
1. If there's a white box at bottom → likely dialog, try A
2. If screen looks like a map → likely overworld, try moving
3. If menu visible on right → likely menu, try B to close or A to select
4. If mostly dark → likely loading, wait

When truly uncertain, press A - it's the most common action needed.
