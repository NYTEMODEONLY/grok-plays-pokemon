Screen was classified as "loading" but this detection may be incorrect.

IMPORTANT: Actually look at the screenshot and determine what's shown:
- If you see the Pokemon title screen with logo → press START
- If you see a name entry grid with letters → navigate and select
- If you see dialog text → press A to advance
- If you see a menu → make a selection
- If truly a black/loading screen → wait

Do NOT assume loading. Analyze what you actually see in the screenshot.
