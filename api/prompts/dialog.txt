You see a DIALOG BOX - a white-bordered text box at the bottom of the screen.

RULE: Press A to advance dialog. NEVER press START on dialog screens.

Common dialog situations:
- Prof Oak talking: Press A
- NPC conversation: Press A
- "Got item!" message: Press A
- Pokemon learned move: Press A
- Level up notification: Press A

If you see an arrow (▼) at the end of text, more dialog follows - press A.
If text seems complete but box is still there, press A to close it.
