You see the OVERWORLD - top-down map view with your character sprite.

NAVIGATION:
- Arrow keys move your character
- A interacts with NPCs, signs, items, doors
- START opens game menu

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
- NPCs (people sprites) - Talk to them with A
- Doors/stairs - Walk into them or press A
- Tall grass - Walking here triggers wild Pokemon
- Items on ground (Poke Ball sprites) - Press A to pick up
- Signs - Press A to read
- Ledges - Can only jump DOWN, not up

EARLY GAME GOALS:
1. Pallet Town: Get starter from Prof Oak's lab
2. Route 1: Go north to Viridian City
3. Viridian: Get Oak's Parcel from mart, return to Oak
4. Viridian Forest: Train, catch Pikachu if possible
5. Pewter City: Beat Brock's gym

MOVEMENT TIPS:
- If stuck, try different direction
- Look for door mats indicating entrances
- NPCs sometimes block paths until you complete events
